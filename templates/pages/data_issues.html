        <h5>How the Data Issues Were Solved</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
        <p>
        During the data preprocessing phase, we encountered several issues related to data quality, including missing values, outliers, skewed distributions, and class imbalance. Below is a summary of how each issue was addressed:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Missing Values:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>For categorical features (e.g., Gender, Married, Dependents), mode imputation was applied.</li>
                    <li>For numerical features (e.g., ApplicantIncome, LoanAmount), missing values were filled with the median grouped by Married and Education.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Outliers:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Outliers were identified using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.</li>
                    <li>Extreme values were capped to the upper and lower bounds to reduce their effect.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Skewed Distributions:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Logarithmic transformations (log1p) were applied to variables like LoanAmount, ApplicantIncome, and CoapplicantIncome to reduce skewness and stabilize variance.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Encoding Categorical Variables:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>All categorical variables were converted using One-Hot Encoding to be suitable for model input.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Scaling:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>All features were standardized using StandardScaler to ensure uniform scale across features.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Imbalanced Classes:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>The target variable had imbalanced classes. To fix this, we used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to generate synthetic samples of the minority class.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These preprocessing steps were crucial to improving the performance and robustness of the machine learning model.

        <h5>How Decision Thresholds Are Used</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
        <p>
            Instead of simply predicting "Approved" or "Rejected", the model outputs a <strong>probability score</strong> representing the likelihood that a loan will be approved. This percentage is then used to make a more informed decision based on the following logic:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Probability ≥ 70%:</strong> The request is <span class="text-success fw-bold">automatically approved</span>.</li>
            <li><strong>50% ≤ Probability &lt; 70%:</strong> The request is <span class="text-warning fw-bold">under review</span>. Additional criteria can be checked to support the decision.</li>
            <li><strong>Probability &lt; 50%:</strong> The request is <span class="text-danger fw-bold">automatically rejected</span>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example: "This request is 73% likely to be approved."</p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            In the review stage (50%–70%), banks may take into account specific features to support or override the decision:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Credit_History:</strong> If available and reliable, a request might be accepted even at 60%.</li>
            <li><strong>CoapplicantIncome:</strong> Joint incomes may indicate more financial stability.</li>
            <li><strong>Low LoanAmount:</strong> Small loans may justify relaxed acceptance criteria.</li>
            <li><strong>Education = Graduate:</strong> Educated applicants generally have better repayment behavior.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This tiered decision-making helps balance risk and fairness in loan approvals.</p>
